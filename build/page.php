                        <p>There is no doubt dogs make wonderful companions and are highly valued as family pets and at Q we realise the importance of dog ownership.</p>

<p>The Gold Coast has over 55,000 registered dogs; a figure which indicates the popularity of dog ownership within our city. So it is no surprise that Q Super Centre is one of the limited shopping centre’s that openly welcomes dogs. We have installed dog watering stations along with handy dog waste bags throughout the centre. Dogs are welcome throughout all outdoor areas of the centre.</p>

<p>Policies for individual tenancies within the centre may vary. If you are unsure if a store allows dogs, look for signage or simply speak to the friendly staff and they will inform you of their policies. Pets other than dogs should be left at home unless visiting a specific store that allows them, such as the vet. Accredited Assistance Animals are permitted in all areas as per legislation.</p>

<h4>Daisy – Doggie Face of Q 2016</h4>

<p>This year’s Doggie Face of Q Facebook competition was a huge success! The winning dog would feature in future advertising on Facebook, the Q web site and media campaigns.</p>

<p>After receiving an amazing 967 uploaded photographs from proud dog owners the winner was finally announced. Daisy is a loving ex racing dog who was rescued at age 4 by her wonderful mum Jayne. When she’s not being a cheeky little rascal, Daisy visits mental health wards as a Delta Therapy dog and brings smiles to those who need it. She not only won the prestige of the Doggie Face of Q 2016 title, but she also won a $500 voucher from Vetcall, a $500 voucher from Pucchi the pet groomers, plus a specially designed dog tag.</p>

<p>If you have a cute dog that doesn’t shy away from the camera keep posted as next year we will be on the lookout for our Doggie Face of Q 2017 star!</p>
